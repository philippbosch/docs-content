The **search bar** functionality within the Scaleway console allows you to quickly find your Scaleway resources.

<Message type="requirement">

1. Log into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).
2.  Locate the search bar in the top navigation bar.
    <Message type="tip">
      You can also access the search bar by typing Cmd + k on macOS and Ctrl + k on Linux or Windows.
    </Message>
3. Click in the search bar and enter the keyword you are looking for. The keyword can be the name or the ID of a resource. 
    <Message type="note">
    As this is the initial version (v1) of the search bar, results are limited. This means that it may not yet include all resources, and a "no result" message may appear even though the resource exists.
